<h2>About</h2>
<strong>BandBrowser - team project by Group 7B  <br> <br>
The function of this app is to allow bands and musicians to connect on a singular site, the aim is to allow users the flexibility in finding others that suit their specific interests and styles.
When entering the site the user will be greeted to a list of posts from all users and bands, from here they can refine what they want shown to them through the search above it.
Logged in users have access to much more functionality. Within the homepage they can create their own posts either looking for bandmates or a band themselves, along with this they can directly interact with posts in a quick and efficient manner. In order to look for bandmates a band needs to exist in the first place, this leads to the second major feature of the app the my Bands section. 
Here users can manage their bands by, editing demographic information like the style of music they perform how committed members are to the band. Other noteworthy manage aspects include removing existing members and the ability to accept or decline other musician invitations to join the band.
Finally the user can access and edit their account, here they can change the instrument they play, their demographic information and even upload a profile picture.
